# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting a vulnerability can be done using the vulnerability disclosure tool located on the Security page (Using the "Report a vulnerability" button above) - **Do Not report vulnerabilities over email**. Please describe the vulnerability in as much detail as possible including: The API endpoint where the vulnerability occurs (Or the exact URL if it is on-platform), how exactly it is exploited, what the result of the exploit is (I.E: What did you gain access to, how did it defy the expected behaviour, etc.), how you found the exploit and how long you believe it has been in existence (if possible to determine).

Reported vulnerabilities will be responded to within 24-48 hours (depending on the severity) by a member of Senior Management and you can expect an detailed update within a week.

Unfortunately, SocialCabin does not currently offer a paid bug bounty programme, but we are grateful and willing to credit any and all vulnerabilities reported provided they have a resonable security threat and are directly related to the SocialCabin platform and not any other third party integration.

### Program Rules
_Important Note:_ You are only permitted to participate in the programme if you are an active member/participant of the SocialCabin private/public beta. If you have found a vulnerability regardless however, please do still report it.

- Only use and test on accounts and Cabins you directly own. Testing should never affect other members (users) of the platform.
- Testing should be limited to sites and services that SocialCabin directly operates. We will not accept reports for third-party services or providers that integrate with SocialCabin through our APIs.
- Do not perform any actions that could harm the reliability or integrity of our services and data. Some examples of harmful activities that are not permitted include: brute forcing, denial of service (DoS), spamming, timing attacks, etc.
- Do not use scanners or automated tools to find vulnerabilities.
- No information about issues found should be publicly disclosed or shared until we've completed our investigation and resolution **and** have explicitly informed you that you are now permitted to disclose the issue or vulnerability found.
